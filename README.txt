Your project should include a README file containing the following information:

1. the libraries required to run the project including the full version of each library.

Example:

numpy==1.15.4
opencv_python==4.1.1.26
scikit_image==0.15.0
tensorflow_gpu==1.12.0
Pillow==7.0.0
scikit_learn==0.22.1
skimage==0.0
tensorflow==2.1.0

2. how to run your code and where to look for the output files.


Here is an example of how to run your code. You can use your own explanation as long as an external user can understand how to run it.

Example:

script: RunProject.py
function: run_project(input_folder_name), where input_folder_name is the path to the folder containing the images 
output: the output path is 331_Alexe_Bogdan/task1 and 331_Alexe_Bogdan/task2
